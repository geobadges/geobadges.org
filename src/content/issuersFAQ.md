## How do I create a Geobadge?
	
Begin by logging into your organization's Geobadges account. Use the toolbar at the top left of the page to navigate to the “issuers” page and select your organization. Here, you click “Create a badge” and enter the image, description, and criteria necessary to receive your badge. You can also link the badge directly to your organization's webpage. Click “Create Badge” to finish.

## What are Tags?

Tags help users find your badge.  More tags increase your visibility by populating your badge across more categories.  You should always tag your badge with one difficulty level: beginner (1), intermediate (2), advanced (3), but can also include the following tags:
 
 *Please limit tags to 3 per badge*  
 - OpenStreetMap  
 - QGIS  
 - Developer  
 - Human Geography
 - Maker

## What is Alignment?

Some badge requirements align with educational standards, making it easier to incorporate these badges into the classroom. If your organization’s badge aligns with an education standard, add the information to this section of the “Create a badge” page. 
  
  
  
## How do I award a Geobadge to an earner?
	 
Your organization’s Geobadges are visible on your issuer’s page. Navigate to the badge you would like to award, and click “award badge.”  

If you would like to award the badge to multiple recipients, select “click here to bulk award” to upload a list of recipients that matches the suggested template offered. To award a single recipient, input their name and a means of contact. Next, you have the option to add a narrative, evidence that they met the criteria, or an expiration to the badge you are awarding. Once finished, click “award badge.”  

The recipient will receive an email alert notifying them of their new badge!
