## What are Geobadges?
Created to leverage the power of mapping and inspire learning, GeoBadges are a geocentric system of microcredentials designed to align with and adapt to 21st century learning standards. Users can earn digital badges for the work they do both in and out of the classroom—everything from participating in the humanitarian relief efforts of OpenStreetMap, to building their own sensors. Created by Storymap’s Jon Marino and convened by the American Geographical Society, GeoBadges offer limitless opportunities for personal, social, and academic growth. The badges are a source of pride that can be shared with friends, educators, and social media at large. Now more than ever, maps are helping students think like global citizens, and Geobadges are making geographic education more accessible, involved, and interconnected.

## How do I set up my Geobadges account?
	 
Geobadges are connected to your email address. This means if you have been earning badges through TechChange, YouthMappers, or other organizations, you should create your Geobadges account using the same email address. This will preserve your badges and allow you to access/earn them across platforms. 

## How do I earn a Geobadge?
	 
The criteria to earn each badge is different. Use the search bar to navigate through badge collections, difficulty levels, and issuers. Once you’ve found a badge you’d like to earn, click on it to view its awarding criteria. Once you’ve met the criteria, return to the badge’s page and select “Claim Badge.”

## How do I claim a Geobadge?
	 
Each badge has a coordinating criteria page that lists what must be done to achieve it. Once you have met all of the listed criteria, you can return to the badge page, select “claim badge,” and fill out the required information including evidence of your achievement. Some badges need to be claimed directly from the issuer. In these circumstances, the badge will have an email address that you can use to contact the issuer and claim your badge.
